// Title: rtctree module
#contents

rtctree is a Python library for interacting with and managing running RT
Components.

**Introduction 

rtctree is a Python library providing an easy-to-use API for interacting with running RT Components and RTM-based systemsrunning on OpenRTM-aist-1.0. 
It allows developers to manage these systems from other programs without needing to learn the CORBA API. Components can be started, stopped, connected together,
have their configuration changed, and so on.

**Requirements
- Python module for ominorb-py and omniidl and omniidl is required.
- Python 2.6 or higher is required because it uses functions that do not exist under Python 2.5.
- If you are using Ubuntu 9.04, you will need to install Python 2.6 manually. Therefore, Ubuntu 9.04 or higher is recommended.

//rtctree requires omniorb-py, including omniidl with the Python backend. If you
//have installed OpenRTM-python, you will have these installed already. If not, 
//you will need to install them manually.
//rtctree uses the new string formatting operations that were introduced in
//Python 2.6. It will not function with an earlier version of Python. It has not
//been tested with Python 3 and it is likely that several changes will be
//necessary to make it function using this version of Python.
//For Ubuntu users, if you are using a version of Ubuntu prior to 9.04, you will
//need to install a suitable Python version by hand. You may want to consider
//upgrading to Ubuntu 9.04 or later (10.04 offers LTS).

**Installation

There are several methods of installation available:
&br;
-After downloading from the repository (see [[repository> #repo] below)] or source archive, decompress and install it in the appropriate directory:
++ Deploy the source.
 $ cd /home/blurgle/src/
 $ tar -xvzf rtctree-2.0.0.tar.gz
++ Run setup.py.
 $ python setup.py install
++ Set environment variables as necessary. This is set by default, but if it is not set you need to set it yourself. On Windows, please make sure that Python's site-packages directory is set to ''PYTHONPATH'' environment variable and Python script's directory is set to '' PATH'' environment variable. Normally these are '' C:\Python 26\Lib\site-packages\'' and ''C:\Python 26\Scripts\ '' (if Python was installed on ''C:\Python 26\'') .

- We recommend using installer on Windows. By using setup.py you can set it more easily than the result. However, depending on the environment, it may be necessary to further set environment variables.

//- Download the source from either the repository (see [[Repository>#repo]], below) or
//+a source archive, extract it somewhere, and install it into your Python distribution:
//++ Extract the source, e.g. to a directory ''/home/blurgle/src/rtctree''
// $ cd /home/blurgle/src/
// $ tar -xvzf rtctree-2.0.0.tar.gz
//++ Run setup.py to install rtctree to your default Python installation:
// $ python setup.py install
//++ If necessary, set environment variables. These should be set by default, but
//if not you will need to set them yourself. On Windows, you will need to ensure
//that your Python site-packages directory is in the ''PYTHONPATH'' variable and the
//Python scripts directory is in the PATH variable.  Typically, these will be
//something like ''C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\'' and ''C:\Python26\Scripts\'',
//respectively (assuming Python 2.6 installed in ''C:\Python26\'').
//- Use the Windows installer. This will perform the same job as running setup.py
//(see #2), but saves opening a command prompt. You may still need to add paths
//to your environment variables (see step iii, above).


**Environment variables

The following environment variables are used:

|''RTCTREE_ORB_ARGS''|A list of arguments, separated by semi-colons, to pass to the ORB when creating it. Optional.|
|''RTCTREE_NAMESERVERS''|A list of name server addresses, separated by semi-colons, to parse when creating the RTCTree. Each server in the list will be added to the tree. Optional.|

The only variable that should normally be set by the user is RTCTREE_NAMESERVERS. Set this to a list of name server addresses, separated by semi-colons, that you want rtcshell to interact with. For example, in a Bash shell, you can run the following:

 $ export RTCTREE_NAMESERVERS=localhost;192.168.0.1:65346;example.com

**The RTC Tree 
The main part of the library is the RTC tree.
 import rtctree.tree
 tree = rtctree.tree.RTCTree ()
This is a tree like a file system created by searching the name server ~ to get the naming context, component and manager. It can be handled in exactly the same way as handling a normal file system. The tree represents the naming contexts, managers, and components registered in all known name servers in a tree structure.
//The core of the library is the RTC Tree:
// from rtctree.tree import create_rtctree
// tree = create_rtctree()
//This is a file system-like tree built by parsing name servers to find
//directories, components and managers. You can treat it exactly the same way as
//you treat a normal file system. The tree represents the naming contexts,
//managers and components registered all on known name servers in a tree
//structure:

 \  
 |-+localhost
 | |-+naming_context
 | | |--ConsoleIn0.rtc
 | | |--ConsoleOut0.rtc
 | |
 | |--another_naming_context
 | |--Sensor0.rtc
 |
 |-+192.168.0.5
   |--Motor0.rtc
   |--Controller0.rtc

//&ref(tree.PNG, nolink);

Each directory in the tree is the normal naming context or root server's root context. The root context of the name server is indicated by '' NameServer '' class. Also, the naming context is represented by the 'Directory' class, and the manager is represented by '' Manager '' class.

The name server is treated as a directory from the root directory. Below that are files and subdirectories. The subdirectory points to the naming context and manager under the root context.

The files are components and managers. Components are represented by the Component class.

Contains various information about the component represented by the component object. You can activate and deactivate components, manage component ports, connect ports, and configure configuration settings.

You can create new component instances in the manager and erase the components.

Every node in the tree also contains a reference to the CORBA object in the objects they represent. You can call IDL methods by accessing this object. Even if there are currently impossible functions with rtctree, you can call IDL methods directly using this CORBA object.

//Each ''directory'' in the tree represents a naming context, which may be the
//root context of a name server, a normal naming context, or a manager. These are
//represented by ''NameServer'', ''Directory'' and ''Manager'' objects, respectively.
//&br;
//Name servers are treated as directories off the root directory, /.  Below them
//are ''files'' and sub-directories. A sub-directory represents a naming context
//below the root naming context of a name server or a manager.
//&br;
//Files are components, represented by the ''Component'' class.
//&br;
//Component objects store a variety of information about the component they
//represent. You can access the component's ports, configuration sets, and so on.
//Use these objects to change configuration values, connect ports to each other,
//start and stop components, etc.
//&br;
//Using Manager objects, you can create new component instances at run-time, and remove running component instances.
//&br;
//All nodes in the tree also store the CORBA object reference to the object they
//represent. By accessing this object, you can call the IDL methods. If something
//is not currently available in rtctree, calling the IDL method on the CORBA
//object directly will be able to achieve what you want to do.

***Building the tree 
The argument of the factory function of the tree ('' create_tree () '') specifies the name server to be analyzed for constructing the tree. Please refer to the function's documentation for details. In general, you can build a tree by passing a list of nameserver addresses or a list of paths. The environment variable ''RTCTREE_NAMESERVERS'' is also checked.
//The arguments to the tree factory function determine which name servers are
//parsed to build the tree. See that function's documentation for details. In
//general, you can pass in a list of server addresses and/or a list of paths (the
//first component of each path is treated as a name server). The environment
//variable ''RTCTREE_NAMESERVERS'' will also be checked for any additional name
//servers to parse. This is a semi-colon separated list of name server addresses.


***Paths
Nodes in the tree are specified by path. The path is a list of strings. The level on the right is one level deeper than the one on the left. An absolute path is required to specify a tree object. If the path exists below the node, relative path specification from the node is also possible.

These path strings are similar to file system path specifications. The root of the tree is indicated by '' / '' ('' \ '' for Windows). The first level is the address of the name server. The level below it is Component, Manager and Naming Context (as a directory). The function '' parse_path '' changes the path of the string to the path for the RTC tree.

For example, the following path:
 /localhost/naming_context/ConsoleIn0.rtc
Shows the component called ''ConsoleIn0.rtc'' registered under ''naming_context'' on the name server running on ''localhost''. When you want to get the object of that component from the tree, you need to change the path to 'Python' with ''parse_path''.
 ['/', 'localhost', 'naming_context', 'ConsoleIn0.rtc']

//Nodes in the tree are addressed using paths. A path is a list of strings, each
//representing a level in the tree one deeper than the previous list item.
//Absolute paths are necessary to address into the tree object. Addressing from
//nodes allows relative paths, provided that the path exists below the node.
//&br;
//When represented as text, these paths resemble file system paths. The root of the tree is represented by ''/'' (''\'' on Windows systems). The first level of entries are name server addresses. Entries below the first level are components, managers and naming contexts (which are represented as directories). The utility function parse_path will parse a text string path into a list of path entries that can be used to address nodes in the tree.
//&br;
//For example, the path
// /localhost/naming_context/ConsoleIn0.rtc
//represents the component ''ConsoleIn0.rtc'', registered in the
//''naming_context'' naming context on the name server running at ''localhost''.
//When used to find the node in the tree representing this component, the path
//should be a Python list:
// ['/', 'localhost', 'naming_context', 'ConsoleIn0.rtc']

***Useful functions

Useful member functions of the RTCTree class and node classes that will be of
particular interest are shown below. This is not a complete list of all
available functionality. Users are encouraged to check the full API
documentation for additional functionality, and examine the rtcshell source
code for usage examples.

**API naming conventions

rtctree follows the standard Python naming conventions as laid out in [[PEP8>http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/]].

&br;

Most importantly, the private, internal API functions begin with an underscore (_). If a function begins with an underscore, it is not intended for use outside the class and doing so could lead to undefined behaviour. Only use those API functions that do not begin with an underscore and have a docstring in your programs.
