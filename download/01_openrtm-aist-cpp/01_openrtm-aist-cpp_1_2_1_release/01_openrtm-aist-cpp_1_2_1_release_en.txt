***** Confirm installation
It is recommended that you confirm that you can create a Visual C ++ project before the workshop.

First, start Visual Studio and click "File"-> "New"-> "Project". &br;
Select '' Visual C ++ '' for the template and select '' Empty project ''.


#ref (vc2017.png, 70%, center)


After entering the project name and clicking OK, a Visual C ++ project is created.

If you cannot select '' Visual C ++ '', install "Desktop development with C ++" according to the procedure of [[How to install Visual Studio Community 2019:/ja/node/6650]].

Also, when using other than Visual Studio 2019, it is recommended to confirm that you can create a Visual C ++ project just in case.

**** How to use the old version runtime of C ++ version
The old version runtime is installed under the OpenRTM-aist directory as 1.0.0 (only for 32bit), 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.0.
Use the system environment variable "RTM_BASE" through the path.

Example) The 1.1.1 version vc12 runtime path can be specified as "% RTM_BASE% \ 1.1.1 \ vc12 \ bin".

**** How to handle when OpenRTP / RTSystemEditor is reduced in high resolution (HiDPI) mode such as Windows10
If you use a high resolution mode such as Windows 10, Eclipse icons etc. may be displayed in a reduced size. The following FAQ explains the solution.
- [[On Windows10, etc., in high resolution mode, icons are too small and hard to see:/ja/content/tool_trouble_shooting_ja # toc1]]

*** Build from source

For details on how to build from source, see [[Building from Source (Windows):/ja/node/6611]] or [[Building from Source (Linux):/ja/node/6612]] .

*** Create deb / rpm package

From 1.1, the creation of deb packages for Ubuntu and Debian and rpm packages for Fedora from the above source code is officially supported.

You can create a package by following the steps below. When creating a package, use the bulk installation script (pkg_install _ ***. Sh) to install the necessary packages in advance.

 $ tar xvzf OpenRTM-aist-1.2.1-RELEASE.tar.gz
 $ cd OpenRTM-aist-1.2.1
 $ ./configure --prefix = /usr --enable-fluentd = yes --enable-observer = yes --enable-ssl = yes
 $ cd packages
 $ make

Packages are created in the pacakges directory.

&color(red){* Install tools such as "dpkg-dev build-essential debhelper devscripts" when creating deb packages on Ubuntu and Debian, and "rpm-build createrepo" before creating rpm packages on Fedora. Must be kept. };
These can be installed by executing [[Bulk installation script:/ja/node/6345]] with the -c option.
