Troubleshootings concerning OpenRTM-aist (C++ edition, Python edition, and
Java edition) were brought together. 

**OpenRTM-aist(General)
***OS(Not depend on OS.) 
****A component which should be running seems to be dead 
 Symptom: A component which has been launched and registered to a name
 server, is displayed as a zombie object in the name service view of
 RTSystemEditor. Even if I drag it down on the system editor, nothing is
 shown.


*****[Cause] You can not reach the host where the component was launched.
You may not have reached the host where the component was launched from the
PC where RTSystemEditor is running for some reason.
At first check whether pings from the PC where RTSystemEditor is running to
the host where the component was launched, are successful.

For example, there are three hosts A, B, and C:
-hostA: the host where the component is running
-hostB: the host where name server is running
-hostC: the host where RTSystemEditor is running

And networks among these hosts are set up like this:

''[hostA]-(networkI)-[hostB]-(networkII)-[hostC]''

In this case, if host B is not configured for routing between ''networkI''
and ''networkII'' appropriately, hostA is unreachable from hostC.
You need to configure hostB in order to reach hostA from hostC.

*****[Cause]Firewall is enable in the host where the component was launched. 
When firewall is enable in the host where the component was launched, these
phenomenon that you can not connect between RTSystemEditor and the component
may occur. 
Please recheck or turn off the configurations for firewall to connect to the
component externally.
#br
***Windows
&aname(tokkenn);

****"The installer has insufficient privileges to access this directory..."
is displayed while executing the installer, and it fails in the
installation.
Please log on as a user who has the Administrator privilege, and install it. 

****Components are not registered to the name service. 
After launching name server and components, I connect to the name server
with RTSystemEditor etc, but components have not been registered.

First, to increase the log level to the highest, please specify the
following configurations in rtc.conf:

 logger.log_level:PARANOID

and launch the components.
If the following message cannot be found in the component's log, the
registration of the name server is not complete:

 naming_svc NameServer connection succeeded: corba/Host name : Port number

In this case, the following causes are considered.

*****corba.nameservers of rtc.conf is not set correctly.
Please make sure rtc.conf the components loads is set correctly. If you set
the host name as openrtm.aist.go.jp, the line shown below must be included
in rtc.conf.

 corba.nameservers: openrtm.aist.go.jp

Also, when you start the name server by specifying port number, you need to
specify the port number, too.  If you specify 1234 to the port number when
launching the name server, you need to set as follows:

 corba.nameservers: openrtm.aist.go.jp:1234

If you do not specify the port number, the default port 2809 will be used.
This is the default port number of omniORB name server (omniNames). If you
use other than omniORB name server, please be careful.

*****The network of the host who launched the component and the host who launched the name server is not connected. 
Please make sure you can connect a network from the host where the component
was launched to the host where the name server was launched.
First, confirm whether the ping pass through or not. If the ping does not
pass through, please check the network configuration again.

Even if the ping pass through, the connection may be prohibited by firewall.
First, please check the configuration of the host where the name server was
launched. The easiest solution is to turn off the firewall. For more
details, please refer to the configuration of each OS and firewall.

*****There are more than two network interfaces. 
When there are more than two network interfaces, you need to specify to
CORBA which interface to use. You should consider both the name server and
the component.

Let's assume that each host has two interfaces and that the address for each
interface is set as follows (mask assumes to be 255.255.255.0):
-Name server host: eth0:192.168.0.1, eth1:192.168.100.1
-Component host: eth0:192.168.0.2, eth1:192.168.11.96

In this case, the name server host and the component host should be
connected by the 192.168.0 network.
So, you need to specify the following interface to use:
-Name server eth0:192.168.0.1
-Component eth0:192.168.0.2

When launching the name server, you need specify the environment variable
OMNIORB_USEHOSTNAME on the name server side.
 (csh)
 > setenv OMNIORB_USEHOSTNAME 192.168.0.1
 (bash)
 > export OMNIORB_USEHOSTNAME=192.168.0.1
 > rtm-naming or launch the name server by omniNames

You may modify in rtm-naming (Unix) or rtm-naming.bat (Windows) directly.

While you modify the configuration of corba.endpoint in rtc.conf on the
component side, you can specify the interface to use.

 corba.endpoint: Interface IP address:Port number
 corba:endpoint: 192.168.0.2:       (In case of not specifying port number)
 corba:endpoint: 192.168.0.2:1234   (In case of specifying port number)

You don't have to specify the port number, but please don't forget to add
'':(colon)'' after the IP address.

**OpenRTM-aist(C++ edition)
***Windows

&aname(errorinit);
****Application error "The application failed to initialize properly..." is generated. 
The error like the above-mentioned might go out when rtm-naming.bat is
executed to start the name server.  This error happens because there is no
run time component in the VC++ library on the execution environment.
OpenRTM-aist (C++ edition) doesn't operate in the environment in which the
development setting of VC++ (Microsoft Visual Studio and Visual C++ Express,
etc.) is not installed. Please install the development setting of VC++.  In
OpenRTM-aist (C++ edition), there are the one of the VC8(VS2005) base and
the one of the VC9(VS2008) base. Please install package (x86) where
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 can be distributed again when you use the
installer of the VC8 base such as OpenRTM-aist-X.X.X-jp_vc8.msi (X.X.X is a
version) and install package (x86) where Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 can be
distributed again when the installer of the VC9 base such as
OpenRTM-aist-X.X.X-jp_vc9.msi (X.X.X is a version) is used. 

***When building in Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition, there is a error of "'windows.h': No such file or directory"
When building in Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition, an error like this
sometimes occurs.
 >c:\program files\omniorb\include\omnithread\nt.h(35) : fatal error C1083:
 include file cannot be opened. 'windows.h': No such file or directory
It seems to be caused by one of these reasons: 1. Microsoft Platform SDK is
not installed, or 2. include file path or library path are not set up
correctly.
:''1. Microsoft Platform SDK is not installed.''|
Install Microsoft Platform SDK.
:''2. Include file path or library path are not set up correctly.''|
There are some situations which cause the symptom that the compiler of
Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition can not find the include or library files of
Microsoft Platform SDK:Microsoft Platform SDK is installed in a different
location from  the install directory of Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition
because of installation order or other. In such a case, add the install
directory of Microsoft Platform SDK to include file search path and library
search path to fix the problem.
--''How to add include file search path''~
Select Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition Menu bar -[Tools]-[Options] and open
the "Options" window. Select "Projects and Solutions"-"VC++directory" from
the tree view at left side.
Change right upper pulldown menu [project to display directory] to [include
file], and add the include file directory of Microsoft Platform SDK (for
example, "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include") to include file
search path.
--''How to add library file search path''~
Similarly, select "VC++directory" at the left tree view in Options window,
change right upper pulldown menu [project to display directory] to [library
file], and add the library file directory of Microsoft Platform SDK (for
example, "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Lib") to library file
search path.

For more details on procedures to add search paths, please refer to help
of Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition or others.


#br
****Error occurs by executing rtm-naming (Windows)
 Sympton: If rtm-naming.bat is executed, an application error occurs. 
It seems to be causes that libraries related to VC++ are not installed.

*****Libraries related to VC++ is not installed. 
When applications such as Visual Studio 2005 etc are not installed, please
install "Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition" from [[Visual Studio 2005 Express
Edition site>http://www.microsoft.com/japan/msdn/vstudio/express/]].
#br
****rtm-naming cannot be executed. 
When rtm-naming.bat was executed, a black window (command prompt screen)
opened and it shut at once. 

*****[Cause]omniORB is not installed. 
Name server ''OmniNames.exe'' of omniORB is usually executed in rtm-naming.bat. 
Because ''OmniNames.exe'' is not installed if omniORB is not installed, the
name server cannot be executed. 
Please download and install omniORB on the download page. 
*****[Cause]2 byte character is included in path of the log directory.
Name server ''OmniNames.exe'' of omniORB is usually executed in
rtm-naming.bat as follows. 
 omniNames.exe -start 2809 -logdir %TEMP%

An environment strangeness several %TEMP% indicates user's temporary
directory usually. 
 C:\Documents and Settings\[user-name]\Local Settings\Temp

Here, it is not possible to execute because omniNames cannot correctly make
the log file when ''User-name'' is Japanese and it ends. 

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods.
:[Method 1]Please do not use a Japanese user-name. |
Please add the user who doesn't use Japanese newly. And, please execute
rtm-naming in the user's environment. 
:[Method 2]rtm-naming.bat is rewritten. |
''Version number bin of C:\Program Files\OpenRTM-aist'' The following parts in
rtm-naming.bat that exists in the under are rewritten. 
 %cosnames% -start %port% -logdir %TEMP% 
~
 %cosnames% -start %port% -logdir [for path not to contain Japanese]
: |
Please make ''Log directory for path not to contain Japanese'' a safe place
by the directory that I have the authority of writing. For instance, C:\tmp
etc.

:[Method 3]Orbd of the Java version is used. |
''Start-orbd.vbs'' appears in examples of the Java version of the start menu
when the Java version and JDK of OpenRTM-aist are installed. This is a
script that starts the CORBA name server attached to JDK. 
Because the problem of Japanese path like omniNames doesn't exist in this
name server, the user-name can start the name server even in Japanese by
using this. 
#br
***Unix
****Download error occurs during package automatical installation.

The automatic installer included in OpenRTM-aist checks existence of
packages and their versions, and if appropriate packages are not installed,
it downloads the packages from the &color(default){download}; site of each
package, and make them available. Therefore, make sure your computer is
connected to Internet to install with our automatical installer.
Although your network connection is normal, when &color(default){download};
error still happens, it may be possible that  &color(default){download};
fails because of network congestion etc, or that locations or names of the
files have been changed in the &color(default){download}; site. In the first
case, try again automatic installation after an interval. In the latter
case, specify your target packages and  &color(default){download}; them
individually to install manually, or modify &color(default){download}; link
addresses in the automatic installer and start it up again. 
After that, if there are changes in  &color(default){download}; sites,
please notice us the details, We appreciate your cooperation.
#br
****Running configure quits due to errors.
Most errors of configure happen when required package cannot be found. When
there is an error, make sure required packages are installed, and headers
and libraries are installed in locations autoconf refers to.

#br
****Running make but the build cannot be completed, or execution errors of make occur. 
It may because packages installation or OpenRTM-aist build are not perfect.
Launch the automatic installer of packages again and start over from package
installation. If some error messages are shown on proceeding screen of
packages installation, install the specified packages manually and run
configure.When configure ends without error messages, execute make again to
finish the build.

****Cannot run run.sh which starts up the sample program, SimpleIO. 
It may be because run.sh does not have execution bit on.
Make the execution bit on, or pass the script to a shell directly in order
to run like this:

 > ls -al run.sh
 -rw-r--r--  1 n-ando  n-ando  1146  4 27 15:12 run.sh
 > chmod 755 run.sh

 Or
 > sh run.sh
#br
****The sample program, SimpleIO starts up, but does not work normally. 
The execution script of SimpleIO, run.sh assumes a terminal window is one of
kterm, xterm, or gnome-terminal. Therefore when you use another terminal
window, rewrite run.sh appropriately.

***Windows
&aname(pythonusage);
****If I execute rtm-naming.py, omniNames shows a "usage:" and exits. 
--''Symptoms''~
If you execute rtm-naming.py in the directory containing spaces such as
"C:\Documents and Settings\Hoge\My Documents" etc, omniNames shows a
"usage:" and exits.

--''Solutions''~
This is a bug due to rtm-naming.py, so if you see the above symptom, try
either solution1 or solution2 below.

---Solution1~
Create the folder of your choice such as "RTMNaming" under c:\ (or location
whose path does not contain any spaces), copy and run rtm-naming.py.

---Solution2~
Modify at the 48th line of rtm-naming.py in C:\Python24(or
Python25)\Lib\site-packages\OpenRTM\rtm-naming as follows:
  cmd = "omniNames -start "+str(port)+" -logdir \""+str(currdir)+"\" &"

&aname(pythonexe);
****python.exe won't start.
Add the Python installation folder (C:\Python26 etc) to the environment
variable Path.
#br

&aname(python);
****There may be several versions of python.exe in some environments where
Cygwin is installed. 
Since there may be several versions of python.exe in some environments where
Cygwin is installed,
even if the environment variable Path is set up correctly, another version
of python.exe which is different from one deployed at this time, can be
started up. This sometimes causes some failure cased by version differences
of Python. Feature of this problem is extreme difficulty to find its reason.
If you use an environment where Cygwin is installed, make sure python.exe is
starting from the Python installation folder when you run OpenRTM-aist for
Python.

-Example of how to confirm : Check version using python -V , or check which
python.exe is executed with "which python", etc (in the environment where
Cygwin is installed).
-Solution against this failure : You can solve this problem by adding Python
installation folder (C:\Python24 etc) to the top of system environment
variable Path(* not user environment variable).

**OpenRTM-aist(Java edition)
***Not depend on OS. 
****The data transfer time is too long. 
The speed might decrease extremely when a large amount of data is sent and
received between RT-Component of the Java edition and RT-Component of other
languages. (It is often generated by the data of 100kB or more. )This is
known to be a problem on the CORBA side of Java, and it is possible to evade
by appropriately setting the time-out. 
The time-out of CORBA can be set by describing it in rtc.conf as follows. 
 corba.args: -ORBTCPReadTimeouts 1:60000:300:1
''100:3000:300:20'' is default in Java (since JDK1.5). 
The above-mentioned means this is changed to ''1:60000:300:1''. 
Items are the following meanings. (It explains from a left item.)
-initial time to wait in milliseconds if a transport tcp read returns 0 bytes
-max time to spend in cumulative waits in milliseconds if a transport tcp
read returns 0 bytes
-max time to spend in cumulative waits in milliseconds if a transport tcp
read of GIOP header returns 0 bytes
-A backoff percentage used to compute the next amount of time to wait on a
subsequent transport tcp read of 0 bytes

Therefore, ''1:60000:300:1'' is the following meanings. 

- Read Thread stops in 1ms when read content was 0 bytes. 
- The maximum accumulation time for which Read Thread waits is 6000ms. 
- The timeout period when the header of GIOP is read is 300ms. 
- Rest time of Read Thread are increased by 1%. 

When a large amount of data is received, all data cannot be acquired for
reading one time. In that case, it usually reads ,divided into portions how
many. Therefore, reading might be completed with about 1ms though it takes
time to read.
In a set value of default, Read Thread will wait for 100ms.Thus, it takes
time to receive a large amount of data. CORBA of Java divides data into
100kB. When data that exceeds this is exchanged, you should add the
above-mentioned setting to rtc.conf.
