**Installing RT System Editor
Because RT System Editor is an Eclipse plugin, it requires Eclipse to be installed. Eclipse is written in Java, so it in turn requires a Java environment to be set up before it can be installed (such as the JDK).

- Please refer to [["Installation of Java execution environment (JRE) of Eclipse":/ne/node/1418#jre_install]] for the installation of the Java execution environment. 
-Please refer to [["Installation of Eclipse of Eclipse":/ne/node/1418#eclipse_install]] for the installation of Eclipse.  

****Installation 
The compressed Eclipse archive is 100MB or more. Extract its contents into the directory you wish to install Eclipse into. There is no installer for Eclipse. Start it by running the eclipse.exe executable on Windows, or the eclipse binary on UNIX.
