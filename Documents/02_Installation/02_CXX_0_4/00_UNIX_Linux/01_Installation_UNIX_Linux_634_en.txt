//*Building and Installing OpenRTM-aist in a UNIX environment 

**Supported OS and Distribution 
OpenRTM-aist-1.0.0 has been tested and validated on the following platforms.

- FreeBSD
- Vine
- Fedora
- Debian
- Ubuntu

**Prerequisites 
The following packages are necessary when installing OpenRTM-aist-1.0.0

+ORB
--Currently, the only ORB supported is omniORB-4.0 or later.
+Gcc version 3 or later is preferred. Although, it is possible to compile with gcc2.95.x, some options need to be specified (see below).

Also, in the following OSes and Linux distributions, script files for the installation of these packages are available under the build directory.
#br
- pkg_install_freebsd.sh
-pkg_install100_vine.sh
-pkg_install100_fedora.sh
-pkg_install100_ubuntu.sh
-pkg_install100_debian.sh

#br

¦ For FreeBSD, Debian and Ubuntu Linux, ACE and omniORB are provided as an OS standard package . You can manually install it without using the above installation scripts by using the package installation tools provided by OS.

On other above OSes, please follow the installation instructions in the package document for each platform. In order to make the compilation of OpenRTM-aist easier, we recommend that you install all these packages in standard directories (/usr,/usr/local...).

**Extracting the Source File 
The first task is to extract the source file OpenRTM-aist-1.0.0.tar.gz into a directory of your choice.

 > tar xvzf OpenRTM-aist-1.0.0.tar.gz
 > cd OpenRTM-aist-1.0.0

**Building OpenRTM-aist 
The building of OpenRTM-aist is performed using autoconf, automake. You can build in the same way as any other package using autoconfig, automake.

 > ./configure [options]

Below is a partial list of options that can be passed to ./configure.

***ORB 
¦Currently, only ominiORB is supported. We plan to support other options in the future.

  --with-omniorb=dir
  --with-tao=dir
  --with-mico=dir
  --with-orbix=dir
  --with-orbacus=dir

***Specifying Type of Wrapper Module (Now is not available) 
The wrapper module for Python which was supported with OpenRTM-aist-1.0.0 is no longer supported now.

***Compiling Using a Version of gcc prior to Version 3.x (gcc2.95.x) 
Errors occur when trying to compile a template using gcc3.x or earlier versions. To fix this problem, the following option should be set.

  --with-gcc2


***Other Options 
Please refer to other available options as follows: 

 > ./configure --help

**Make 
Please make sure configure executed successfully.
Once the configure executed properly, you can now run make.

 > make

In order to complete the installation, at least the following directory should be built successfully.

  OpenRTM-aist/src/lib/rtm
  OpenRTM-aist/src/lib/rtm/idl
  OpenRTM-aist/utils/rtm-config
  OpenRTM-aist/utils/rtm-naming
  OpenRTM-aist/utils/rtc-template

After the build has completed successfully, we now have to install the header files, library files, utility commands..

 > su
 # make install
