*** Installing from a zip file

Download the "Jar file and samples" from [[here>/en/content/openrtm-aist-java-100-release]] and extract it to a suitable directory. The extracted location does not matter, but do not change the directory structure (If you wish to change the directory structure of the extracted files, refer [[here>/en/node/502#Antbuild]]). The "jar" directory in the extracted location must be added to the RTM_JAVA_ROOT environment variable.

Click the "New" button to create a new environment variable.

- Variable:RTM_JAVA_ROOT
- Value: Directory extracted from the zip file containing the "jar" directory. The "jar" directory contains the class library file (OpenRTM-aist-X.X.X.jar) and commons-cli-1.1.jar, and should be below a directory called "OpenRTM-aist\<version>". Be sure to include "OpenRTM-aist\<version>" in RTM_JAVA_ROOT.

Click "OK" and close the dialog.

Note that to create a system-wide environment variable, you must have sufficient privelages.
